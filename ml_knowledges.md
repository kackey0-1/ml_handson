# Model index
 
## Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means
- MeanShift
- Gaussian Mixture Model(=GMM)
- Variational Bayesian Gaussian Mixture(= VBGM)

## Supervised Learning
- Linear Model
  - Simple Linear Model
  - L1 Lasso Regression
    - linear model with penalties
  - L2 Ridge Regression
    - [//]: # (TODO)
  - Logistic Regression
    - Binary Logistic Regression
    - Multiclass Logistic Regression
- KNN(K-Nearest Neighbor)
  - supervised ML algorithm for classification
- SVM(Support Vector Machine)
  - supervised ML algorithm for classification
    1. K-NN distances are computed 
    2. These distances are not between data points, but with hyper-plane, that better divides different classifications
- XGBoost
  - Optimized Gradient Boosting algorithm through parallel processing tree-pruning, handling missing values and regularization to avoid over-fitting / bias
  - Evolution of version of Decision Trees. this has been widely used in fraud detection field(unsupervised learning). and has had many positive results.
- Deep Learning
  - Convolutional Neural Networks
    - Used for image classification
    - Used with 
      - Kernel Selection
        - filters or kernels are computations on a sub-matrix of pixels
        - We use multiple convolution filters or kernels that run over the image and compute a dot product
      - Stride
        - the amount of stride we choose affects the size of the feature extracted
      - Max Pooling Layer
        - Max pooling layer helps reduce the spatial size of the convolved features and also helps reduce over-fitting by providing an abstracted representation of them
  - Matrix Factorization
    - Used for recommendation system

## Reinforcement Learning(RL)
RL provides a software agent that evaluates possible solutions through a progressive reward in repeated attempts.
it does not require labels. But it requires a lot of data and several trial and the possibility to evaluate the validity of each attempt.
- Q-Learning
- deep Q-network(DQN)
- deep deterministic policy gradient

[//]: # (TODO)
# ML Evaluation 
- Classification model
  - Binary Classification
    - When there is an imbalance between true and false ratio, it is necessary to modify the classification threshold
    - https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/precision-and-recall
      - Precision: Rate of correct positive identification
      - Recall: Rate of real positive correctly identified
