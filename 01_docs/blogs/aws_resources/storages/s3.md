# [For AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate] Understanding S3]
- S3 Feature
  - Strong read-after-write consistency for PUTs and DELETEs of objects (eventual consistency is opposite)
    - While PUT/DELETE function, GET or LIST function returns old value or new value
    ![](https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2020/s3_eventual_consistency_no_num_1.png)
   
  - Amazon S3 will automatically scales to high request rates
    - ex: at least 3500 PUT/POST DELETE and 5500 GET requests per second per prefix in a bucket
  - Multi-Part Upload is recommended for larger objects
    - With single PUT operation, user can upload objects up to 5GB
    - For larger than 5GB files, user must use multi-part upload
  - Bucket Valid URLs
    - https://<REGION_NAME>.s3.amazonaws.com/<BUCKET_NAME>
    - https://s3.<REGION_NAME>.amazonaws.com/<BUCKET_NAME>
  - Minimum and Maximum 
    - file size
      - 0Bytes and 5Tera-Bytes
    - total volume
      - Unlimited
    - upload file size
      - For 5GB by single PUT method
      - For larger than 100MB by Multipart Upload
  - AWS API
    - DELETE API
      - DELETE API call on the object does not delete the actual object, but places delete marker on the object
  - Work with S3 Event
    - Use S3 event notification and configure Lambda function which sends email using AWS SES non-sandbox
    - Use S3 event notification and configure SNS which sends email to subscribed email addresses
  - Cross-Region Replication
    - Cross Region Replication require versioning to be enabled for both
      - Source bucket and Destination buckets

- Default Setting
  - Encryption(Server-Side Encryption) is not enabled
  - No bucket policy exists

- Configurable setting
  - Versioning
    - When you delete an object in a versioning-enabled bucket, all versions remain in the bucket, and S3 creates delete marker for the object
  - Transfer acceleration
    - enable fast/easy/secure transfers of files to and from your bucket
  - Life Cycle Policy
  - Server Access Logging 

- S3 Storage Class <!-- TODO --> 
  - S3 Standard
  - S3 Standard-IA
  - S3 Intelligent-Tiering
  - S3 One Zone-IA

- [Metadata](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingMetadata.html#object-metadata)
  - System-defined object metadata
    - x-amz-server-side-encryption
    - x-amz-version-id
    - Content-Length
  - User-defined object metadata
    - When uploading an object, you can also assign metadata to the object
    - Metadata names must begin with "x-amz-meta-" to distinguish them from other HTTP headers
 
- Storage Gateway
  - File Gateway
    - Store and access objects in Amazon S3 from NFS or SMB file data with local caching.
    - File Gateway presents a file interface that enables you to store files as objects in Amazon S3
    - Using the industry-standard NFS and SMB file protocols
  - Volume Gateway
    - Store and access iSCSI block storage volumes in Amazon S3.
  - Tape Gateway
    - Store virtual tapes in Amazon S3 using iSCSI-VTL, and store archived tapes in Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
  - Stored Volume Gateway
    - <!-- TODO --> 
  - Cached Volume Gateway
    - <!-- TODO --> 

- Signed URLs and Signed Cookies regarding S3 feature
  - S3 Pre-Signed URLs
    - S3 Pre-Signed URLs require you to change your content URLs
    - S3 Pre-Signed URLs expires after its defined expiration date
  - CloudFront Signed URLs
    - CloudFront Signed URLs allow you to restrict access to individual files
    - Signed URLs require you to change your content URLs each user access
  - CloudFront Signed Cookies
    - CloudFront Signed Cookies allow you to control access to multiple content files
    - Signed URLs **DOES NOT** require you to change your content URLs each user access

- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing(CORS)
  - CORS defines a way for client web applications loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain

- Logging
  - [Access Logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerLogs.html)
    - Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket
    - When you enable server access logging and grant access for access log delivery through your bucket policy, you update the bucket policy on the target bucket to allow s3:PutObject access for the logging service principal
  - CloudTrail Logs
    - CloudTrail Log allows you to find that what request was made to Amazon S3
      - the source IP address from which the request was made, when it was made
    - CloudTrail captures a subset of API calls for Amazon S3 as events, including calls from the Amazon S3 console and code calls to the Amazon S3 APIs

## Glacier Bucket
- Cannot directly upload files to Glacier through the AWS S3 console
